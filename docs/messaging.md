# Camp Asimov Messaging System

## Primary Value Proposition
Camp Asimov is Los Angeles's selective robotics build lab for serious young engineers.  
Small cohorts, high mentor access, and structured technical rigor produce real outcomes: FTC-ready systems, CAD portfolio assets, autonomous routines, and polished demo-day reels.

## Supporting Pillars
1. **Small Cohorts, High Standards**  
   Cohorts are intentionally capped to preserve build quality, faster feedback loops, and meaningful mentor time.
2. **Expert Mentoring, Engineering Rigor**  
   Students are coached by experienced robotics educators using professional workflows, safety discipline, and accountable subsystem ownership.
3. **Real Build Output**  
   Students leave with tangible engineering artifacts and presentation-ready proof of work, not just exposure.
